    This is used to identify analysis results for previous, related Jenkins builds. It should be set to the same CodeSonar hub project path used in your <code>codesonar build</code> and <code>codesonar anaylze</code> commands. The project path is determined by the codesonar <code>-project</code> option if present, or the base name of the CodeSonar project file. This field is required.
